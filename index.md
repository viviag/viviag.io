I used to study biology, software engineering and mathematics and continue to interact with all these fields in various ways.

My current interests include:

- Algebraic topology and applications
- Homological algebra and category theory
- Domain specific languages
- Mathematical software
- Distributed systems
- Algebra and applications in general

Please visit [links page](/links.html) of this website to see in more detail what I am doing.

And I welcome you in my blog.
I appreciate any focused discussion and will happily accept any correction I agree with.
I write these texts mostly in order to reflect on professional experience, polish understanding of some things or share some mathematical path.
