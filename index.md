title: About

This is my personal site, focused on my professional and close to professional activity.

I used to study biology, software engineering and mathematics. Mostly the last.
I work as engineering manager/software architect and try to maintain my mathematical skills and ability to read papers in fields of my interest.
I remember some biology on a level of good general culture with some more deep parts.

My current interests intersect with:

- Algebraic topology and applications
- Group theory and representation theory
- Homological algebra and category theory
- Domain specific languages
- Haskell theory and practice
- Mathematical software
- Software architecture
- Efficient organization of processes in teams of very smart people

Please visit [links page](/links.html) of this website to see some selection of my background and current activity in more detail.

I also welcome you in my [blog](/blog).
I write these texts mostly in order to reflect on professional experience, polish understanding of some things or share some mathematical path.
I almost do not take actions on their propagation apart from sending links to interested friends and colleagues and having an RSS feed.
If you managed to find it and have something to say (fix me, ask me etc.), please don't hesitate to do it in [issues](https://github.com/viviag/viviag.io/issues) of the underlying Github repo or using contacts written on the [links page](/links.html).
