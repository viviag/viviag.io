Mostly the last. I work as engineering manager/software architect and try to keep my mathematical skills updated and myself capable to read papers in fields of my interest. I remember some biology on a level of good general culture with some more deep parts.</p><p>My current interests intersect with:</p><ul><li>Algebraic topology and applications<li>Group theory and representation theory<li>Homological algebra and category theory<li>Domain specific languages<li>Haskell theory and practice<li>Mathematical software<li>Software architecture<li>Efficient organization of processes in teams of very smart people</ul><p>Please visit <a href="/links.html">links page</a> of this website to see some selection of my background and current activity in more detail.</p><p>I also welcome you in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
