_[To index of the series](https://viviag.io/tagged/hask/)_

This post starts a series of texts trying to explore the category of Haskell
types without impredicativity (platonic Hask).

Despite the series is probably more interesting for those who adopt Haskell
after category theory, I will try to recall all necessary definitions. I
expect some level of mathematical culture to be comfortable with this
series, otherwise, it may become hard to read.

Probably someone interprets it as a sort of intro to category theory by example.
