This post starts series of texts trying to explore category of Haskell
types seen without impredicativity (platonic Hask).

Viewpoint taken for this series is the following: I have some experience with categories in mathematics, tried to
write Haskell and have recently heard that Haskell types form a
category. What can be said about it and what follows?

Despite series is probably more interesting for those who adopts Haskell
after category theory, I will try to recall all necessary definitions. I
expect some level of mathematical culture to be comfortable with this
series, otherwise it may become hard to read.
