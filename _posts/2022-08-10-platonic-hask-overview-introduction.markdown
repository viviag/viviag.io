_[To index of the series](https://viviag.io/tagged/hask/)_

This post starts series of texts trying to explore category of Haskell
types seen without impredicativity (platonic Hask).

Despite series is probably more interesting for those who adopts Haskell
after category theory, I will try to recall all necessary definitions. I
expect some level of mathematical culture to be comfortable with this
series, otherwise it may become hard to read.

Probably someone interprets it as sort of intro to category theory by example.
