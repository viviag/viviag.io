Initial release of a tool. See
[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dbmonitor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dbmonitor).

This is a database consistency monitoring tool with Telegram alerts. See
README on [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dbmonitor).

Its most advanced feature is a hot swap of any checks and configuration
files. Key dependencies: async, fsnotify, hasql, telegram-bot-simple.

Several usage scenarios I have in mind:

1.  DBA or QA engineer uses corporate vpn and has direct access to
    production or staging database from his working machine. He can
    install dbmonitor, set it up for required databases, run it
    (Unix-like systems case) via `dbmonitor > .monitor.log &` and add
    line `@reboot dbmonitor > .monitor.log` to crontab. After that if he
    has some suspicion he can add new check and he will instantly start
    to receive alerts. It can be useful to find bugs related to
    incorrect program termination or lack of ACID guarantees.
2.  Same setting as 1. on a local machine of responsible developer who
    want to perform long-term testing of corner cases before opening
    merge request.
3.  In MCCME we use it on a Kubernetes pod in a docker container. Hence
    we do not use hot swap feature, but instrument still works for its
    purpose and gains persistence, however is not as convenient in usage
    as in case 1. We (credits to [Egor
    Kuzmichev](https://github.com/aeifn)) provide docker image suitable
    for this scenario.

I appreciate any feedback here and in
[issues](https://github.com/pandora-mccme/hdbmonitor/issues).
